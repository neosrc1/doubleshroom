                        I've also turned 18 years old as of recent. Birthday is June 13!<br/><br/>
                        Things I do are the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pursuing an IT career - right now, I'm in my third year of an IT assistant apprenticeship. Heck, I even placed very well in a local juniors competition. I ❤️ IT</li>
                            <li>Working on a video game, inspired by the "objectkin" - object show characters, so to speak. This is something that needs a ton of time commitment, which I cannot muster up just yet - this will have to rest for now.</li>
                            <li>Write stories and create original characters inspired by the objectkin - this is already shown off in part on the OC viewer, accessible by clicking the "eye" icon on the bottom bar. Although, I do have plans on adding a dedicated "catalogue" for written works to this site, complete or not - stay tuned!</li>
                            <li>Roleplaying - This is something I do almost exclusively within friend groups, but it serves as great inspiration for things to write and actually was my gateway into writing.</li>
                            <li><s>Creation of visual arts</s> - for now, I have given up on this. You may see some tidbits of it here and there (example being the site graphics), but I won't be making this a regular hobby. Trust me, I've tried it for a few years, I've gotten to a point where I have to force myself to open my drawing software and attempt a drawing. <b>Not fun!</b> Last drawing: <a href="https://doubleshroom.neocities.org/other-images/clippy.png" target="_blank">Clippy profile picture</a>, August 19th, 2025</li>
                            <li>Being a typing and keyboard hobbyist - to most, this shouldn't be a surprise, since I code for a living. But I do care about having a nice keyboard to type on, and this kind of competition is something I can get behind. Top speeds are around 125WPM. See <a href="https://monkeytype.com/profile/neosrc" target="_blank">my monkeytype profile</a> if you're sceptical.</li>
                            <li>Playing video games - This is something that I have done for most of my life, and I consider myself to be very passionate when it comes to video games. Although, this hobby of mine tends to now be pushed aside in favour of more productive endeavours, like coding and writing. Current video game obsession: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/526870/Satisfactory" target="_blank">Satisfactory</a>.</li>
                            <li>Speedrunning - Nowadays, I rarely practice this, but I do speedrun some select games (most notably RE:RUN and Jelly Drift).</li>
                            <li>Video editing - I used to do this semi-regularly, mostly focused on content creation style of editing. Though, as I rarely produce videos to begin with, this skill doesn't have much use at the moment.</li>
                            <li>Speedcubing - I don't do this competitively (yet), but I do know how to solve a 3x3. I'm still in the process of solidifying my consistency with 2-look CFOP.</li>
                        </ul>
