## Demos

Please be patient for first load. It may take some time as agents are loaded one by one.

## Usage


### NPM / Webpack

```
npm install clippyts
```

```ts
import clippy from 'clippyts'

clippy.load('Merlin', (agent: Agent) => {
    // do anything with the loaded agent
    agent.show();
});
```

## Actions
All the agent actions are queued and executed by order, so you could stack them.

```javascript
// play a given animation
agent.play('Searching');

// play a random animation
agent.animate();

// get a list of all the animations
agent.animations();
// => ["MoveLeft", "Congratulate", "Hide", "Pleased", "Acknowledge", ...]

// Show text balloon
agent.speak('When all else fails, bind some paper together. My name is Clippy.');

// move to the given point, use animation if available
agent.moveTo(100,100);

// gesture at a given point (if gesture animation is available)
agent.gestureAt(200,200);

// stop the current action in the queue
agent.stopCurrent();

// stop all actions in the queue and go back to idle mode
agent.stop();
```
